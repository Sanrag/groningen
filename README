= BUILDING

Groningen requires protobuf version >= 2.4.1. In case you have own locally built
protobuf, make sure to specify the right path to it as follows:

$ export PROTOC_EXECUTABLE=/somewhere/protobuf-2.4.1/build/bin/protoc

By default /usr/bin/protoc will be used.

Next, get the sources and build it:

$ mvn assembly:assembly
$ mvn assembly:single

= RUNNING

$ java -jar target/groningen-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
